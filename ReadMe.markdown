# Task for Web Designer / Front End Developer

The project involves developing an interactive and responsive web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, with API integration for mapping functionalities. It includes features such as form handling, interactive image display, and integration with external APIs for mapping. The application is designed to be responsive using media queries and integrates with XAMPP for local development. Git is used for version control, ensuring seamless collaboration and code management.


## Installation with XAMPP

### Prerequisites

- XAMPP (latest version)

### Steps

1. Create a folder, open a terminl and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tolis-pro/tolis-pro.github.io`
2. Move the folder to your XAMPP `htdocs` folder.
3. Start XAMPP and ensure Apache  service is running.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-project-folder`
   (Replace `your-project-folder` with the actual folder name in `htdocs`).


# Development Process and Design Choices

## Agile Methodology

The development process follows Agile principles, allowing for iterative development and flexibility in responding to changes and feedback throughout the project lifecycle.

## Steps Involved

### Planning and Requirements Gathering:

- Identified the need for a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
- Discussed functional requirements, including interactive functionality and API integration with maps.

### Design Phase:

- Designed the user interface (UI) using responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Integrated interactive features such as dropdown menus, form submissions with validation, and responsive image handling.

### Implementation:

- Implemented front-end using HTML5 and CSS3 for layout and styling, ensuring a modern and intuitive user experience.
- Used JavaScript (including frameworks like  vanilla JS) for client-side interactivity, such as form validation and interaction with elements.
- Backend development utilized PHP for server-side processing, including handling form submissions, interacting with databases, and API integration.

### Testing and Debugging:

- Conducted thorough testing of the application across different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality.
- Debugged issues related to form handling, API requests, and responsiveness using browser developer tools and error logging.

### Deployment:

- Deployed the application locally using XAMPP for testing and development purposes.
- Prepared the application for deployment to a production environment, considering security measures and performance optimizations.
